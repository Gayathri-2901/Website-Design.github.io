    <p>1.An F1 hybrid is a first-generation hybrid plant that comes from two carefully selected parent plants. A hybrid may take years to create, since gardeners need to carefully select specific characteristics such as disease resistance, uniform ripening, or other desired traits. </p>
    <p>2.You may occasionally see F2 hybrids, as well. These would be considered the “grandchildren” of the original plants and may or may not have the same traits the plants were initially bred for. That doesn’t mean they don’t have some winning qualities in their own right, just that they’re further removed from the original.</p>
    <p>3.As for All-America Selection winners, it helps to briefly define All-America Selections, or AAS. The non-profit organization tests new varieties of plants for “garden performance” all over North America with the help of expert horticulturalists, many of whom come from university extension programs, garden centers, or well-regarded seed wholesalers. </p>
        
    <p>4.Winners are selected in both regional and national categories, and to be considered, the plants must have “at least two significantly improved qualities.” These plants are also free of genetic engineering, although the seeds may or may not be organic.</p> 
        
    <p>5.The winners are announced three times each year and divided into four types (edible-vegetable, flowers from cuttings, flowers from seed, and herbaceous perennials) and six regions (Great Lakes, Heartland, Mountain/Southwest, Northeast, Southeast, and West/Northwest, as well as national).</p>
    <p>India is the second largest producer of the fruits and vegetables in the world after China. The country has diverse topography and climate, which ensures availability of fruits and vegetables in every season. During 2021-22, India produced 204.61 million metric tonnes of vegetables and 107.10 million metric tonnes of fruits.</p>
    <p> The area under cultivation of fruits stood at 7.09 million hectares in 2021-22, while vegetables were cultivated at 11.28 million hectares. In addition, India leads the world in the production of ginger and okra, along with banana, papaya, mango and guava</p>
    <p>Production and export of Indian fruits and vegetables have increased in recent years. During 2021-22, India exported fresh fruits and vegetables worth US$ 1.527.60 million, which comprised fruits worth US$ 750.7 million and vegetables worth US$ 767.01 million. India mostly exports to its neighbours, namely the UAE, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and Nepal.</p> 
    <p>India's global market share is still only about 1%, but its horticulture products are becoming increasingly popular due to advancements in cold chain infrastructure, research, contemporary post-harvest technologies, supportive governmental policies and quality control procedures.</p>
